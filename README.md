## Disclaimer

    This contract is created for only creators who
    have already created their NFT collection without
    JSON metadata. This contract has been used to create
    tutorials, and was created for the purpose to teach
    people how to create smart contracts on the blockchain.
    EdFRAX will not be liable in any way if for the use
